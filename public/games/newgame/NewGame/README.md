NewGame Staging
===============

Use this space for quick prototypes and experiments before they become named projects.

When something sticks:
- Move it into `Games/` or a dedicated project folder at the root.
- Add a small README (overview, stack, run commands, status).
- Note any shared assets kept in `Assets/`.

Clean-up reminder: archive or delete abandoned prototypes periodically so this area stays lean.
