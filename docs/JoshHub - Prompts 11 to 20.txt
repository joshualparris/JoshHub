The Plan, Prompts 11-20
Here’s what I’d do for Prompts 11–20 (each one is a clean “upgrade slice” that makes JoshHub more alive, more useful, and more you).
Prompt 11 — Capture → Auto-sort (the engine)
Build a fast Capture panel (text/voice later) that lets you save a thought in 5 seconds, tag it (Faith/Family/Health/etc), choose kind (note/link/memory/task), and it lands in the right place automatically.
Prompt 12 — Dashboard 2.0 (today view that actually runs your day)
Create a “Today” dashboard: Abide, Love, Serve, Steward, Play tiles + next 3 calendar events + top 3 tasks + one “grace” reflection card.
Prompt 13 — Command Palette / Hotkeys everywhere
Proper Ctrl/Cmd+K with actions: capture, add task, add checklist run, start routine, jump to area, export/import, pin/unpin, search.
Prompt 14 — Global search + tags + smart filters
A real search page (or omnibox) across everything: life items, notes, tasks, routines, projects, links. Add tags and saved filters (“NDIS”, “MS”, “DCS”, “Marriage”, “D&D”).
Prompt 15 — Tasks that aren’t boring (and don’t shame you)
Add Tasks with:
* “Today / This Week / Someday”

* recurring tasks

* gentle streaks (optional)

* ADHD-friendly “next tiny step” field

* “done list” by day (celebration + evidence).

________________
Prompt 16 — Routines runner (morning/evening + custom)
Turn routines into runnable flows:
   * start routine → checklist view → timer steps → log completion

   * store “last run” + notes (“worked/didn’t work”)

   * templates: wind-down, morning anchor, conflict recovery, weekly review.

Prompt 17 — Marriage tools (Gottman-inspired, gentle)
A “Love” area module:
      * Love Map question of the day

      * Bids notice log (tiny)

      * Repair scripts (tap to copy)

      * “Same team” debrief card after conflict

      * weekly check-in agenda.

Prompt 18 — Health dashboard (data import + manual logging)
Local-first health hub:
         * import Withings/Welltory exports (CSV/JSON) if possible

         * show simple trends: sleep duration, HRV, RHR

         * quick daily check-in (“energy / mood / movement / sunlight”)

         * keep it non-obsessive: “track to serve love”.

________________
Prompt 19 — Family care systems (NDIS + MS lanes)
Two sub-hubs:
            * Sylvie NDIS: provider directory, appointment notes, goals, next actions, budgets (basic)

            * Kristy MS: appointment tracker, medication/treatment notes, fatigue-friendly planning cues (kind, not clinical).

Prompt 20 — “JoshHub Studio” (creative playground hub)
The fun core:
               * D&D idea generator cards (hook/NPC/location/twist)

               * story seeds for kids

               * game dev idea board (core loop/vibe/next step)

               * “joy library” (best memories, funny moments, wins)

               * quick-launch links to your games/apps and “what to build next”.

If you want a good build order: 11 → 12 → 13 → 14 → 15 → 16, then pick 17/18/19 depending what’s heaviest right now, and keep 20 as the “delight engine” so the whole thing doesn’t turn into admin.
If you say “write Prompt 11”, I’ll format it exactly like Prompt 10 for Codex.


________________
JoshHub - Prompt 11
Prompt 11 (Codex) — Build “Capture → Auto-Sort” (the engine of JoshHub)
You are ChatGPT Codex inside VS Code. Implement Capture as the fastest way to add anything into JoshHub, and automatically route it into the right section (Faith/Family/Health/Finance/Work/Tech/Travel/Legacy) with tags.
Constraints / Goals
                  * Must run in browser (PC + Android) at http://<local-ip>:3000

                  * Local-first: persist to localStorage now (no backend required yet)

                  * Extremely fast UX: open Capture, type, hit Enter, done

                  * All data structured, searchable later

________________


1) Data model (create/update types + storage)
Create a new file src/lib/models/capture.ts (or similar) with:
Enums
                     * LifeArea: "faith" | "family" | "health" | "finance" | "work" | "tech" | "travel" | "legacy" | "inbox"

                     * CaptureKind: "note" | "task" | "link" | "memory" | "prayer" | "idea"

Core type
export type CaptureItem = {
  id: string;
  createdAt: string; // ISO
  updatedAt: string; // ISO
  area: LifeArea;
  kind: CaptureKind;
  title: string;        // short summary (auto-derived if needed)
  content: string;      // main text
  url?: string;         // if kind=link or content contains a URL
  tags: string[];       // user tags + auto tags
  pinned?: boolean;
  status?: "open" | "done" | "archived"; // for tasks
  dueDate?: string;     // ISO date-only optional
  source?: "manual" | "import";
};


Storage
                        * Implement src/lib/storage/captureStore.ts with CRUD:

                           * listCaptureItems(): CaptureItem[]

                           * addCaptureItem(input: Partial<CaptureItem> & { content: string }): CaptureItem

                           * updateCaptureItem(id, patch)

                           * deleteCaptureItem(id)

                           * searchCaptureItems(query: string): CaptureItem[] (simple contains match on title/content/tags)

                              * Use localStorage key: "joshhub.capture.v1"

                              * Always sort newest first.

________________


2) Auto-sort + auto-tag rules (simple but useful)
Create src/lib/logic/autoSort.ts:
inferKind(content: string): CaptureKind
                                 * If contains URL → link

                                 * If starts with todo: or task: or - [ ] → task

                                 * If starts with prayer: → prayer

                                 * If starts with memory: → memory

                                 * If starts with idea: → idea

                                 * Else note

inferArea(content: string): LifeArea
Use keyword heuristics (case-insensitive):
                                    * Faith: jesus|prayer|psalm|bible|devotional|scripture|church|worship

                                    * Family: kristy|sylvie|elias|marriage|love map|bedtime|parenting|date night

                                    * Health: hrv|sleep|withings|welltory|workout|run|steps|protein|meal|headache

                                    * Finance: budget|mortgage|unisure|super|tax|insurance|rent|weekly|

                                    * Work: la trobe|ask la trobe|dcs|dubbo christian school|ticket|crm|shift

                                    * Tech: code|bug|github|vercel|react|server|nfc|app|

                                    * Travel: fiji|tasmania|trip|holiday|itinerary|packing|

                                    * Legacy: memoir|letters|will|story for descendants|
 Default: inbox

extractTags(content: string): string[]
                                       * Pull #tags from text

                                       * Add auto tags based on detected area/kind (e.g. kind:task, area:health)

                                       * De-duplicate, lowercase, max 12 tags.

extractTitle(content: string): string
                                          * If first line is short (<80 chars) use it

                                          * Else take first 8–12 words.

3) UI: Capture page + quick-add component
Implement a new route/page: /capture
Page layout
                                             * Title: Capture

                                             * Description: “Drop anything here. JoshHub will sort it.”

                                             * Main input: a big text area (multi-line), auto-focus, supports:

                                                * Enter = save (unless Shift+Enter)

                                                * Shift+Enter = newline

                                                   * Row of quick buttons/toggles (optional):

                                                      * Area dropdown (default “Auto”)

                                                      * Kind dropdown (default “Auto”)

                                                      * Tags input (optional)

                                                      * “Pin” toggle

After save
                                                         * Clear textarea

                                                         * Tiny toast: “Saved to Health → Tasks” (whatever was inferred)

                                                         * Show “Recent Captures” list (last 20) with:

                                                            * icon for kind

                                                            * title

                                                            * chips: area + tags

                                                            * click opens a side panel (or modal) to edit/delete/mark done

Navigation
                                                               * Add “Capture” to top nav (it already exists in the UI; ensure route works)

________________


4) Integration points
                                                                  * When a capture is kind="task", also set status="open" by default.

                                                                  * Expose a lightweight selector so other pages can show:

                                                                     * “Latest 3 captures”

                                                                     * “Open tasks”
Leave hooks/exports for later.

5) Quality requirements
                                                                        * TypeScript strict, no any

                                                                        * Reusable components where sensible (CaptureInput, CaptureList, TagChips)

                                                                        * Minimal, clean styling consistent with existing JoshHub UI

                                                                        * Add basic unit tests for autoSort functions if test setup exists; otherwise add a small dev test page section that prints inferred results for a sample input.

________________


________________
6) Acceptance tests (manual)
After implementation, I should be able to:
                                                                           1. Go to /capture

                                                                           2. Paste: Task: Book OT appointment for Sylvie #ndis → becomes area=family or health (reasonable), kind=task, tag includes ndis

                                                                           3. Paste: https://joshuaparrisdadlan-stack.github.io/campaign-copilot/ → kind=link, area=tech

                                                                           4. Paste: Prayer: Jesus help me love Kristy well today → kind=prayer, area=faith

                                                                           5. Refresh page and all items persist.

________________


Now implement Prompt 11 end-to-end: data model, storage, auto-sort logic, /capture page, nav link fix, and basic tests/dev verification.
