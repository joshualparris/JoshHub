_JoshHub North Star


Here’s a clean way to shape Josh Hub so it actually serves your real life (A–M) — without becoming another “project” you hide in.
1) The one-sentence north star
“Fear God and keep His commandments — and let that shape how I love, work, lead, and steward my health.”
2) The 6 core sections (matching your A–M)
1) Abide (Jesus at the centre)
* Daily devotional + prayer + “what’s Jesus inviting me into today?”

* Truth for today pulled from your “Truths” doc (identity over lies; Jesus as Lord of every part of life).

2) Love (Kristy + kids first)
   * “2-minute check-in” card every morning

   * Love Map prompt (one question/day)

   * Repair scripts + “same team” close-out for conflict nights.

3) Serve (work with integrity)
      * Now → “Finish La Trobe well” checklist

      * Next → “DCS ramp-up” checklist

      * A simple “Top 3 outcomes today” + “done list” (protects you from ADHD shame loops)

________________
4) Steward (health + MS/NDIS load)
         * Family health dashboard: appointments, providers, goals, notes, next steps

         * Sylvie: OT / Speech / psych, plus a “providers” contact card and visit notes

         * Your own plan: sleep/HRV/movement/nutrition check-ins (simple, not obsessive)

         * Include a gentle “MS support” lane for Kristy (treatments, appointments, energy days)

5) Belong (community + outdoors + books)
            * Weekly “community anchor” + “outside time” + “reading/Bible” rhythm (because these are stated values for you).

6) Understand (family systems + psychology + skills)
               * Family systems “map”: patterns, triggers, triangles, boundaries, differentiation.

               * “Psych insights” page summarising what you’re working on: ADHD strengths + attention regulation/stress/interpersonal focus, plus the trauma memory note and EMDR openness.

3) The home screen (so you actually use it)
A single dashboard with 5 tiles:
                  1. Abide: Devotional + one truth

                  2. Love: check-in + one Love Map question

                  3. Serve: today’s top 3 (work)

                  4. Steward: next appointment + one health action

                  5. Review: “What went well?” + “Where do I need grace?”

________________
4) Two guardrails so it doesn’t become a rabbit hole
                     * **“Is this sin?” + “Is this agreed by Kristy?” decision filter baked in (you literally wrote this as a key test).

                     * Time-box mode for hyperfocus: start timer → finish → forced “return to people” prompt.

If you want, I can turn this into a one-page PRD + navigation map (screens + data needed) and then we pick whether Josh Hub lives as a Notion-style system first or a proper app.
One question to aim it: when you open Josh Hub on a rough day, what do you most want it to do first—steady your heart with Jesus, help you repair with Kristy, or tell you the next practical step?

Absolutely — Josh Hub should have a “Delight & Create” spine, not just “manage & optimise”.
Here’s how I’d bake your fun/creative life in properly, so it’s not an afterthought.
Add a 7th pillar: Delight (Play, Create, Explore)
This lives alongside Abide/Love/Serve/Steward/Belong/Understand.
What goes inside “Delight”
1) Create Studio (maker mode)
                        * Idea Inbox (voice/text quick capture) + tags like DnD / app / story / ministry / family / tech

                        * Creative Sprint button (25 min timer + “what am I making?” + “next tiny step”)

                        * Worldbuilding Vault (DnD locations, NPCs, plot hooks, loot tables, campaign logs)

                        * Story Forge (kids stories, memoir fragments, “1 paragraph a day”)

2) Play Arcade (instant joy)
                           * A beautiful “card wall” of your games with:

                              * Play now button (opens the link)

                              * version selector (e.g. Whispering Wilds v1/v2/itch)

                              * “what I learned building this” notes (optional)

                                 * Optional: embed some games directly via iframe when possible.

3) Adventure + Memories
                                    * “Family Adventures” log: beaches, hikes, trips, photos, wins

                                    * A “make another memory” prompt list (cheap local adventures)

________________


4) Nerd Corner (because it’s you)
                                       * Sci-fi/fantasy reading list + “quotes that hit”

                                       * Tech experiments (“home lab”, “JoshTap”, AI prompts that worked)

Update the Josh Hub home screen: include joy up front
Instead of 5 tiles, make it 6:
                                          * Abide

                                          * Love

                                          * Serve

                                          * Steward

                                          * Belong

                                          * Delight ← one click to play or make something

And add a toggle:
                                             * Mode switch: “Steady” (calm day) vs “Playful” (creative day)
Same data, different vibe.

________________
How it links to your existing apps (clean + practical)
Make a “Projects” page with categories:
                                                * Dubbo/DCS tools

                                                * Moving/Logistics

                                                * Campaign/D&D

                                                * Games
 Each item stores: name, url, description, tags, status, last touched, notes.

Then later you can evolve it to:
                                                   * auto pull GitHub info (stars, last commit) if you want.

One design rule that’ll keep it balanced
Josh Hub must always offer two doors:
                                                      * “Do the next right thing” ✅

                                                      * “Make/play something small” 🎨

Because you’re not a robot. And joy is fuel, not a distraction.
If you want, I can write the next Codex prompt to scaffold this as a PWA dashboard with tabs (Home / Life / Projects / Delight / Data / Settings) + your existing links preloaded.
